Good evening and welcome back for the final night of our 12 parish mission Lent Matters and as a reminder we will have a reception immediately after tonight's talk in Patrick Hall and so you can have a chance to visit with Father James and Father Christopher and some fellowship with fellow members of our parish. We are also taking up a collection for our mission preachers. You can make your donation in the box in the back of the church or if you want to give at a later time you can take an envelope home with you. You also can give online through We Share and then confessions will be heard as usual after the mission talk Father Michael and Father Edmund will be hearing confessions tonight and brothers on behalf of St. Patrick Parish we are grateful for such a wonderful mission thank you for coming to Columbus and for being with us during this time of renewal and retreat and so now I handed over to Father James Sullivan for our final evening of Lent Matters. Usually Father Paul takes care of this I'll have to do this tonight. Glad to see all the Dominican sisters are here they multiplied two three and four thank you sisters they don't matter to the collection because they rarely give anything but I'm glad you came nonetheless. I said I think I said this last night but I do want to thank Father Paul for making this sort of structure of the parish mission to be like a retreat to have time to adore the blessed sacrament extra times for confession of course but even to maintain a prayerful atmosphere in the in the church throughout these past three days which is not easy when you're also celebrating the salinity of St. Patrick so I want to thank Father Paul for that and also before and I know the round of applause at the end of tonight will be a little overwhelming I'll get teary and you'll get emotional too that's a reminder what's coming but I do want to give Father Paul a little round of applause for all that he did for planning this so thank you Father Paul. He's been a very gracious host and it's not easy having Father Christopher for a few extra days in the priori so I do want to thank him for that too. So this passage is taken from the gospel of St. John and it as I said earlier in the week this would be in a way the gospels would be following St. Peter and the transformation that takes place in him as he lived as an embraced the theological virtues because I think there are many times when we live out our faith that we can be overcome by the abstraction of it all that it can be a little too distant for us even a notion of how does God become man how is there through how are there three persons in one God well how does the faith matter to us what does it really do well St. Peter is the first well other than the blessed Virgin Mary the the first witness to the transforming power of Christ grace of living in faith and hope and charity. Tuesday evening when we began our mission we saw St. Peter calling asking the Lord to call him out on the water and then only once he gets there to be filled with fear and to see just the storm around him until he cries out to the Lord to be saved and last night Father Christopher read the passage in Luke chapter 5 of the miraculous catcher fish that Peter as tired as he was and washing up the nets after a long fruitless night of work trusts Jesus and casts the nets over the side of the boat for the miraculous catcher fish well tonight faith and hope leads St. Peter to the shore of the sea of Galilee once again and it's here where St. Peter learns the best lesson and the only lesson that will last that of love. When they had finished breakfast Jesus said to Simon Peter Simon son of John do you love me more than these Peter said to him yes Lord you you know that I love you he said to him feed my lambs a second time he said to him Simon son of John do you love me he said to him yes Lord you know that I love you he said to him tend my sheep he said to Peter the third time Simon son of John do you love me Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time do you love me and he said to Jesus Lord you know everything you know that I love you Jesus said to him feed my sheep truly truly I say to you when you were young you fastened your own belt and walked where you would but when you are old you will stretch out your hands and another will fasten your belt for you and bring you where you do not wish to go this he said to show by what death he was to glorify God and after this he said to Peter follow me the gospel of the Lord this is one of my favorite chapters in the gospel of St John chapter 21 because verse 15 says when they had finished breakfast and I always think what can go wrong after a good breakfast sausage and cheese and bacon and some eggs you know be delicious this passage I'm sure you've heard many times and I don't doubt the truth of this St. Augustine points out that this triple confession of Jesus's love is the triple reversal of his denial of Christ and so that every time he denied Christ Jesus had him make this profession of love and and I think that's true I think it's beautiful but there's one more consideration to it that I I want to offer you tonight and it's one not that I'm stealing from anyone I'm just borrowing it I'll give it back to them if it doesn't work but I was on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land with a group of American priests we were at the North American College and my job was basically not as cute but I was supposed to be Julie McCoy remember from the love boat and I was the activity director and and we went on this pilgrimage and we were standing there by the the Sea of Galilee at the Franciscan spot they have everything locked up there so if you ever think they're peace-loving friars they're not they defend that territory very vigorously so we're there on the Sea of Galilee at the space at the space called the primacy of Peter because this is where Jesus entrusted to Peter the task of feeding his flock tending his sheep so the and he it was a Franciscan the one who was giving us the door so you know I'm really stooping to a new low taking something from the Franciscans but I find this absolutely fascinating so he says in his description of this passage and maybe it doesn't as we're reading the passage we're like yeah there's something well why does Jesus keep repeating himself you know well what we don't have in English are the Greek verbs I'm not going to give you Greek don't worry those are the worst homilies ever I'm not going to give you Greek words but there are distinctive Greek words for the type of love you're talking about whether it's a full love or just a love of friendship is it an erotic love there are all these distinctions in Greek that are in the New Testament and so what Jesus is asking Peter is Peter do you love me this much do you love me this much and Peter responds each time I love you this much now you remember I said that this parish mission was about the transformation in one way of St. Peter and Scripture and if we think about where St. Peter starts it's in the state of bravado that it's all about him it's all about what he's going to do for Jesus I don't know if you're a big fan of the chosen my brother's not I don't care I love watching it and I know it didn't all happen that way but I also don't think Saint Paul fell from a horse on his way to Damascus and yet we all think of the conversion of Saint Paul by him falling from a horse because Caravaggio great Italian painter put a horse in the picture so there is something to artistic license but when we when we think of this great gift of love that Jesus is asking of Peter he's giving Peter every opportunity to go back to the way that he was right Peter do you love me this much and Peter would naturally have said yes Lord I love you even more than that right you see the dilemma Peter instead says Lord I love you this much this small little bit then Jesus said the second time do you love me this much giving Peter just to be sure do you love me this much and Peter says again Lord I love you this much you see Peter's getting it his relationship with the Lord is is not about being better than Jesus what's the sense of that but rather admit how much you need Jesus admit admit how your life cannot be lived without him sometimes when we surrender problems to God it's almost like we're we're co-workers with God like God you take care of this part of the universe today and I'll take care of my pot over here yet no that's not how this relationship works he's God and we're not and we will never be God we will always be a creature and we will always be in need of him the third time Jesus asks he says Peter do you love me this much he changes Jesus changes the third time do you love me this much Peter and Peter says yes Lord I love you this much now the first time I heard that from this Franciscan tour guide on the Sea of Galilee it really did give me an insight into this passage and I'm not discounting what St. Augustine said but I think that that is the nature of love it's the nature of charity it's the nature of God's love transforming us maybe not into something different yet but I think God's love first has to base us in reality so that we come face to face to who we really are not who we want to be but who we truly are because that is is when the real work can begin I used to tell the novices sadly none of these men were my novices they would have been better if they were few of mine are still survived to this day but anyway I would say listen you can spend all this year presenting to me your false self but none of that's going to do you any good when Jesus comes to get your art in life I can only work with real material you give me your true self and I'll help you and we all know that in our life that we can't hide we can't run away I mean you can do that for a short time but you can't live that way and so Peter at this moment on the Sea of Galilee on the shoreline just after having breakfast confronts himself really for the first time in his life because he's able to see his reflection of himself in Jesus last night I I ended with that beautiful image of the Silver Smith and when the Silver Smith sees his own image in the silver he's purifying then he knows it's done well this is the reverse of that it's us looking into Jesus and seeing ourself in his love for us because Jesus would embother with us if he didn't love us he wouldn't spend all the time he does he doesn't he wouldn't move our heart he wouldn't open our mind he wasn't he wouldn't do all the things that he does if he didn't love us and that's what what Peter had to come face to face with that it wasn't about what he was going to do for Jesus but it's what Jesus was already doing in him and that's why this surrender of ourself is so important our giving ourself over to the Lord completely for everything that we need most especially this transformation of our life one way to think about the love of God is this example now I am not the let's just say overly athletic type I'm not even the athletic type I'm not even passively athletic I don't even like to watch sports they're moving around too much it wears me out it exhausts me to look at them who moves like that so until someone said to me one day not too many years ago they said wow I don't know why they said wow that then they said father did you play football in high school I'm like wow no no one ever told me should I have I mean if I could have stood there and just blocked half the field okay I see the benefit of that but no no one ever recruited me for the football team so I'm not athletic I was back visiting my family when I came back from Rome I had an assignment in Boston and then in Providence so I was probably around too much for their comfort but anyway that's what happens when you give people your address you can just show up at their house around dinner time you know or slightly before so I'm in the backyard of my sister's house playing with my nephews that's what uncles do right now I'm not athletic as I said but I can throw a ball you know unfortunately my nephews on athletic either so they couldn't catch the ball but once we once we matched that relationship I throw you catch it worked okay so I'm playing with my older of the two nephews Liam these are all Irish I'm telling you it drives me crazy but anyway so I throw the ball to Liam Liam drops the ball I said Liam get the ball he throws it back to me I catch it I can at least catch a ball or at one time I missed it I had Liam go get it because I'm not this is not gonna wear me out so well he didn't throw it correctly so he throws me the ball I throw him the ball had an ice game of catch that's the first stage of love that's how charity works in our life the ball it's red let's say it's red it's a red ball the ball is charity it's God's love and and God's love is first of all and I'm sorry to break this to you God's love is first of all for God it's not for you you're not in this yet it's God God and remember what the Catechism says in the first paragraph God infinitely perfect and blessed in himself and a plan of sheer goodness freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life so God was doing just fine without us he didn't need us which makes the gift of creation and salvation redemption all the greater because he did it just for us so he throws us the ball and all God says is throw it back to me give my love back to me because I want you to love me with the love that's worthy of me and and what love is that is that our love is not our love we don't have the love that we don't have that much love I can barely love the people I'm supposed to love I can't even think of loving God the way he needs to be loved so God gives us his love and he says love me back with that love and we give that love back to God we throw the ball back to him and then he throws it to us and then he says this is where you come into the story he says now love yourself with that love right and that's the great part because there's no amount of love in this world that loves us the way God loves us and you can have the most attractive wife or husband you can have the greatest kids and you can have a super boyfriend or girlfriend but that love will never compare to God's love for you because God's love for each one of us is an eternal love and there are depths to that that we will never exhaust ever so God says love yourself with my love then he says give it back to me because it's this this is catch now we're playing catch he gives me his love I love him back with it he gives me the love again I love myself with it now here's the problem my nephew Connor I told you they were a virus the Connor comes over and Connor says to his brother Liam throw me the ball and Liam says no because he likes play I don't know why because he's not a very good catch but he likes playing catch with his uncle and I'm not even his favorite uncle they all remind me of that but I don't care because these children kind of even catch a ball so obviously there are eye hand coordination issues motor skills they're never gonna do much in life so Connor wants the ball Liam says no and I said to Liam I said Liam throw the ball to Connor he said no he throws it back to me well it's my ball so I throw it to Connor you see it's God's love Connor I said Connor throw the ball to your brother he says no of course he says no because Liam said no you're following the story this is this is how we live Connor says no he didn't throw the ball to me I said I know that but it's my ball throw it to your brother he doesn't he throws it to me finally as this goes around a few times I get them all what having oh we're having a blast until their sister came over Nora and she ruined the whole game but that's what she does in the family she's the destructor so we stop playing catch and someone goes in crying and my sister yells at me and it's another fun family time with the Sullivan family but I have to love other people because that's what God commanded us to do Jesus says that love one another as I have commanded you and he doesn't say love the people you already like he doesn't say love the people who you know love the people that are he says love everyone love everyone as I love them and all we're doing if we could get this through our thick little heads all we're doing is sharing the love of God with everyone I'm not even tapping on even using my love that might be nice right but all I'm doing is sharing his love I'm throwing that little red ball to anyone that I find anyone that'll catch the ball back you know not everyone does that you love people I'm sure in this life and they refuse your love so you move on to contestant number two and then you wait for number three it and it just continues that way you love the Lord your God with your whole mind body soul strength and you love your neighbor as yourself which means you after loving God first then receive God's love for you and then you share God's love with others because you yourself have been loved and for people who can't love other people it's because they won't let themselves be loved by God and that's the great sadness really which means they need love all the more and yet they put up all these defenses against being loved the catechism reminds us that God's very being is love by sending his only son and the spirit of love in the fullness of time God has revealed his innermost secret and it's this God himself is an eternal exchange of love father son and holy spirit and he has destined us all to share in that exchange that's why love alone lasts and that's why not no amount of knowledge of the faith no amount of suffering in this life will prepare us for heaven the way that the simple and most profound lessons of love will of loving God of receiving his love for us and of giving that love to others one of my many assignments and I've had lots I don't know why I haven't figured that out yet but we do have a motto in the province just because you move around a lot doesn't mean you're well liked so one of my assignments and I was only there for a year was Louisville Kentucky at our parish there St. Louis Bertrand which is another wonderful parish like St. Patrick's and downtown there were some guests visiting and I had to show them around and we went down to I mean it's like an outdoor mall type thing a plaza pavilion something or other and because it's in the south there are a lot of historical markers from the Civil War and although Kentucky's a little slow I mean mock Twain said when the world ended he wanted to be in Louisville because everything happens 20 years later there he said it I didn't say that I just repeated it and Louisville Kentucky did join the Civil War after it ended they joined the Confederacy once the war was already over so that's so did the speed they're at so downtown I'm walking around and showing these visitors you know downtown Louisville and I stumble upon a historical marker sign you know those metal scientists went around St. Patrick's I think just in the front maybe and I I'm like oh and let's look at this because I'm an excellent tour guide so I point out things I've never seen before that's the way you give good tours and and you know what it was it's a historical marker from March 18th 1958 so we just had this as March 20th as in it so two days ago was its anniversary on that date March 18th 1958 Thomas Merton a very famous monk from Getsemini Abbey in Getsemini Kentucky was downtown he was with his abbot running errands and something happened to him on that corner it's its fourth and walnut or fourth and now it's Muhammad Ali Boulevard he stood there he looked at the crowd of people Chris crossing on the street walking on the sidewalk going into stores coming out of stores and this overwhelming sense of love came upon him and he loved them he loved each one of those persons he calls it even like they were they were walking around like little bursts of sun light what an incredible experience of God's love and it wasn't that he loved them with his own love I mean there are plenty of reasons why we don't love each other but do we have one reason why we don't love with God's love for each other and even more so if that historical marker's there at that corner in downtown Louisville where one monk out on Samaritan looked up and loved everybody he saw why isn't the perimeter of the church marked with those historical markers every time we've done that or the primary parking lot wouldn't that be something boy the friars actually love each other be careful the world might change but to look around and see everyone and be overwhelmed by God's love for them that's the miracle of charity that's how God's love transforms us and changes us into being free from our own limitations just like Peter was recognizing that this is just about being an instrument of God's love of being a vessel for his love to get from God into the world we all know that that beautiful prayer and him the prayer of Saint Francis make me a channel of your love of your peace well there's another prayer I came across of of Saint Francis that whether it's authentic I don't know but it seems to express the same sentiment and it's how I want to end my reflection tonight and it's put to music French composer by the name of Poulonc P-O-U-L-E-N-C and this is the text the music is beautiful but this is the text of the prayer that Saint Francis prayed O Lord I pray to you that the power of your love burning and sweet may absorb my soul and remove it from all that is under heaven so that I may die for love of your love since you have died for love of my love now have you ever thought about that having love for God's love now there are plenty of times when when we can find ourselves deficient like Saint Peter that we only love the Lord this much but coming to that realization is really the point of real change because knowing that only so much of us is this well then God can provide the rest to die for love of his love that's holiness that's all we have to do and that's how we have to live our life Thomas Merton said divine strength is not given to us until we are fully aware of our own weakness and know that the strength we receive is indeed the gift and not the reward of our own excellence maybe when our own love is exhausted and we find our love renewed it's simply God's love in us that we've experienced because we had nothing else to give but that's when the Lord begins to give through us we're going to stand now and sing love divine all loves excelling which is number 93 in the Lumen Christi Bluehemno number 93 love divine all loves excelling all the love in us excelling joy of heaven through heaven come now this is how the time of hell Jesus nós I pray that I'll caress you. For here I know what they've come. Chant of Th beautiful Sabbath Feud and Pinnestive I will sing for you, I will sing for you. Good evening. I, of course, well maybe not, of course, but you know we've been doing lint matters, we've been going through the theological virtues and the linten penances, the traditional penances of the church, right? And for penances thus far we've had prayer and we've had almsgiving. So it falls to me as Father said in his intro video for this linten mission, it falls to me to talk about fasting, even though I maybe you think I could use some fasting even myself. But before I launch into that, Father also promised in that video and you know from the previous two nights that I can't tell you anything until I've told you an embarrassing story about your pastor, Father Paul. Now if you know Father Paul, you know that Father Paul is a big achiever. He's a real go-getter and you may be aware that Father Paul is such a go-getter that one novishit was not enough for him. He needed to do two novishits. And I actually met Father Paul for the first time between those two novishits, we go back a long way. And you know we sort of stayed in touch and chatted and this and that and you know I remember texting him one day and I said listen, you know I think you should know you know you'd been a novice, you'd been a Dominican novice and I'm going to, I'm applying. He says, well me too. I said, oh all right, good. And I'll never forget we arrived at the novishit that first day, me for the first time, Father Paul for the second. And our parents were with us and I remember that it was very sweet. My mother leaned over to his mother. I don't know if you guys have had the pleasure of meeting Rosie Marrage. She's so great. I don't know what happened with Paul. But you know my mother leaned over to Paul's mother, Father Paul's mother Rosie. And she said, can I get your number? I don't know how to do this. You've done this before. Maybe you can help me and Rosie said, oh of course, of course. And you know I was kind of thinking the same thing here. I have this friend of mine and he's done this before. Now we're here together and he can sort of help me out. And over the year, Father Paul was very good to me at different points. From time to time the older brother thing could get a little on my nerves. But on the whole he was really, really compassionate, thoughtful, hey don't, that's going to, you'll get in trouble, don't do that. That sort of thing. Anyways, back to that first day. We're getting a tour of the priory from one of the novices, the class before us, who's getting ready to make his first vows in just a little bit. But first there's a little overlap between the guys who are going to be leaving and us coming in. And he's giving us a tour of the house and we get to the sacristy. And he says, now have you guys seen the image of, it's not very big, but the image of the sacred heart and the stairwell. And we hadn't been around much yet. He says, well you will see it. And a long time ago that image of the sacred heart wasn't there. In fact, in this whole priory there were no images of the sacred heart. And then one year on the feast of the sacred heart there was a fire. There was significant smoke damage. And then afterwards as it, well we should probably get an image of the sacred heart so this doesn't happen again. But brother, now father, Brendan said, now you know that fire actually, maybe he was because there was no image of the sacred heart. But there was a human cause. That fire started right here in the sacristy for the house chapel. Look, look there on the floor, you can see where the floor is kind of melted. He says it was all because some novice was such a dummy. Just he was cleaning up the sacristy and he looked at the thurble and the coals weren't read anymore. And so he put them in the trash can. But they weren't out. And so he had this whole fire. And he said, can you believe that? I mean, how dumb do you have to be? I mean really what a blockhead. And father Paul from the back of the group said, that was me. And I thought to myself, maybe this isn't the guy to show me the ropes after all. But of course in his graciousness, he did. And I'm very, very grateful for the help that he gave me then and for his invitation to come and be part of this parish mission now. But that fire on the feast of the sacred heart points to can point us to the fire of the Lord's heart for us, his love for us, the love, the charity in his sacred humanity and the heart of his sacred humanity for each and every one of us, which is, that's what we want, right? We want to receive that love like father was saying, we catch the ball. But then we want that love in our hearts so that we can love him with that same love that he gave us. As a beautiful little prayer, heart of Jesus on fire with love for me and flame my heart with love for thee. And fasting can help us to keep that fire in our hearts, fire of his love that we want to give back to him, fasting can help keep that fire burning. Now it's not lost on me that I am talking about fasting and once we wrap up here, we're going to go to St. Patrick's Hall, presumably there will be food because we're going to be having what Father James calls a potty and in English we call a party. But fasting is not about never having fun or never having food that tastes good. That's not what Christianity is about. So how can it be what something that is so important to Christianity is fasting is all about? And fasting is not about weight loss. Though as I said, you know, I could probably lose a little. Fasting is about freeing ourselves, freeing ourselves so that we can give ourselves more perfectly. That's what fasting is about. Charity means loving God for his own sake, the same way that God loves God. But it's only possible when He pours His love into our hearts and yet He gives us that love. But things, our attachment to things and to pleasure, ways us down and gets in the way. Loving God means giving ourselves to Him. But we are often much more accustomed to taking than we are to giving. We live in a, it's almost cliché to say, we live in a consumerist culture. We're always taking something in, whether it be TV or a podcast or social media or just surfing the web or music or food or alcohol or, you know, on and on and on. We're always, seems like we're pulling something in from the outside because I'm not enough and so somehow, right? And we think to ourselves, you know, life is hard. I need some pleasure to help me. I deserve this. Do you? Do you deserve it? Maybe, I don't know. Do you need it? I don't think so. I don't know what you think you do. All of these various pleasures, they tie us down and they make us soft and weak. I don't know if you guys have ever seen the Pixar film Wally. But it's, you know, they live, there's a futuristic society in space and everyone has all of their material needs met. And they can't even walk anymore. They just float around on inner tubes, basically. And they can do that to us and it distracts us, you know. There's this beautiful quote from Pope Benedict XVI and he said to a gathering of young people. And I just think it's endlessly applicable in the times in which we live. And he says, the world promises you comfort. You were not made for comfort. You were made for greatness. And fasting helps us to strive for that greatness. It's strengthens us. We realize, actually, I don't need social media the way I thought I did. I don't need that drink at the end of a long day the way I thought I did. I don't need the podcast or the other noise or fill in the blank. I don't need meat. Here we are in the end. I don't need meat the way I thought I needed it. I can actually narrow my focus, leave all those distractions to the side, sort of put on almost blinders, like a race horse, and focus on the end that I'm striving for. You can strive hard, run hard with nothing held back and give myself entirely to God. We can embrace that through fasting so that we're no longer weekly reaching for the next pleasure to sustain us, to comfort us, and then on to the next and then on to the next. Life is hard, but we can't deal with the difficulty of life by getting pampered. Deal with it by getting tough. And we find that we are able to give rather than always needing to receive, needing to absorb more when we toughen up a little bit. I want to be clear, pleasure can help us a lot. Thomas Aquinas talks about remedies for sorrow, and a lot of the things that he talks about are little pleasures, your favorite food, things like this. And sometimes that can help us, it doesn't solve all our problems, but it can help us get through, sort of softens, lessons, a painful situation. But you know what starts out as ice cream for a special occasion, and ice cream, when I've had an especially bad day, can easily turn into ice cream every day, or maybe ice cream twice a day, or three times a day. There's no end to it. Ice cream is great, but it can distract us. And this is why I think there's a connection between fasting on the one hand and chastity on the other. Not just because, as Aquinas says, actually, right, abstaining from food and from drink can decrease the intensity of desires against chastity, although that's true. And it's not just because both fasting and chastity are about self-denial. They're connected, they're related, because both are self-denial for the sake of a greater gift of self. I sometimes talk about that with engaged couples that I'm working with and helping them to get ready for marriage. You know, chastity now, and later it continues in marriage, but chastity now is preparing you. You're not giving the rest of your life to this man, to this woman, just so you can always be receiving. You have a love for this person. You have a desire to give yourself completely, or at least until death, to the point of death. And so, self-denial, little acts of self-denial, now remaining chaste as you approach your marriage as you prepare, this will help you. It trains you to be able to give yourself, because he's worth it. She's worth it to you. So you can deny yourself for him or for her. St. Joseph, I think, and his lily can be instructive here. Of course, St. Joseph is a great patron of chastity. And there's a beautiful image of St. Joseph holding the Christ child by the, I guess all of my painters, I think this mission have been Spanish. I don't know why, I guess they like St. Joseph in Spain. But, along Zomigel de Tovar, and it's wonderful because he's holding the child Jesus. And their eyes are locked. You can hardly see Joseph's eyes, because he's just gazing so intently on the Christ child. And Jesus is looking back up with him, at him, not laughing. Sometimes we see, baby, Jesus laughing. And I like that a lot. I like to laugh as Father Paul or the other Dominican friar's catellium. But Jesus is looking up at Joseph with such seriousness, a real intensity of love in the eyes of this little baby. And their eyes are locked. And isn't that the union of charity, that moment isn't that what it is that we're striving for. But in his hand, as he's holding the child Jesus sort of loosely in this hand, sort of, you know, the, maybe the forearm is behind Jesus's head, he's holding a lily, the sign of his chastity. It's because it's his chastity that enables him to love, to give himself perfectly, completely to the Lord Jesus. Or at least I thought it was a lily, but then I saw that the English title was Joseph with the child in the flowering rod. Go figure. But as I said, I think it still works. As I said the other night, it's not in Scripture, but the legend where we get the image and art of Jesus of Joseph with his staff blossoming at the end is the legend that that's how Joseph out of a group of eligible husbands, possible husbands was chosen to be engaged to marry. And what do we know about that love? It was a love of self denial. Their marriage, pretty unique, not everybody's called to that, but a marriage where they had this deep and intense love for one another. And yet, you know, not just chaste, but celibate. Self denial, chastity, fasting, holding back from the pleasures of this world, allow us to give ourselves. And it's not because all pleasures bad. As I said, we aren't Puritans. We're going to go to St. Patrick Hall, and I'm hoping I don't know for a fact that I'm hoping there'll be snacks. But pleasure can hold us back, especially, certainly, the attachment to pleasure, and it can weaken us. That's why it's good for us to fast. In the idealism of our youth, I think many of us have the desire to give ourselves completely, to make a heroic self-sacrifice. That's why people like Braveheart, which, you know, it's okay. But like, that's why people like it, because he gives all. And that's why people like the Lord of the Rings, and, you know, fill in your favorite hero thing. It's because we admire that. We want to be like that. But as we grow up, we find that the moment of definitive and final self-sacrifice, hasn't come yet, or still alive. We haven't died. We haven't given it all up. And instead, we have daily life, adulting as my generation sometimes calls it much to the annoyance of those older than us. And I think sometimes people look at their lives, and they think, gosh, wouldn't it be easier if I could just be a martyr? I could do it once. Get it all out of the, you know, just there it is, complete. Really though? We can't hardly even give up Facebook, or Instagram if you're younger, or TikTok if you're younger than that. We think we're ready to give up our lives. When we look at our Lord on the cross, on the crucifix, He is saying to us, this is how much I love you. And when we fast, we mean it's a way that we can say, this is how much I love you. But you might be thinking to yourself, really shouldn't I love Jesus way, way, way, way, way, way more, then Facebook, or Meet, or Alcohol, or Fill in the blank. Doesn't that seem kind of pathetic to say, oh, Jesus, I love you more than chocolate. Really? Yeah, we should love Jesus way, way, way, way, way more than chocolate, or Facebook, or Alcohol, or Meet, or whatever it is. We should give our whole lives. And sometimes we say that. We say, you know, Jesus died for me, and I'm probably not going to get to be a martyr, so I will live for Jesus. But how do we know if we're doing it? It's easy enough to say, but how do I know that I'm actually doing it? Giving up things, even little things, fasting can help us to know. It can remind us as we go through our days, I've made a decision. Every time you're a little hungry for whatever that thing that you've given up is, that thing that you're fasting from, every time you sort of feel that little pull, you remind yourself. It's your reminder. I'm putting God first. I'm living my whole life for Jesus, and this little twinge of discomfort reminds me that I should be willing to give anything for Him. And it can show us also the difficulty, that we still have a long way to go, that we still have disorder desires as Father James was talking about last night, desires that interfere with our love for Him. But little by little, even by small fasting, small self-denial. We can loosen the grip of passing things, passing pleasures on our hearts, so that we are free to love, free to give ourselves, free to give ourselves entirely to Jesus. That's what fasting is about. Ultimately, that's what Lent is about. And that's why our Lenten penances matter. They help us to grow in faith and in hope and in love, so that we can give ourselves entirely to Jesus. Heart of Jesus on fire with love for me. Inflame my heart with love for thee. St. Joseph, pray for us. Thank you guys so much for coming to our mission. I know I've seen some of your faces every night, and it's been such a pleasure to share all this with you. As I mentioned, several times, I'm sure you've got the hint, we will have a reception in just a moment. Firstly, however, if you attend a parish mission, then you are eligible to receive a plenary indulgence. Not too shabby, right? And you know the normal conditions for receiving a plenary indulgence are to go to confession and receive Holy Communion within a week before or after. I think it may, you don't quote me on it, but I think it may have been extended to a longer period. But you folks here at St. Patrick's, you're pretty good. I bet you can manage within a week. And to pray for the intentions of the Holy Father. And of course to be free from attachment to sin. That's the tricky one, but you can at least get a partial or get a plenary for somebody you love in purgatory. So let's pray now the our Father the Hail Mary and the Glory be to receive the plenary indulgence. Please kneel if you're able. Our Father. Who are the Father? Hallelujah to the One in the Ain't. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. honor as it is heaven. Give us this day our early bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not to temptation but deliver us from evil. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of I am. Jesus holy Mary, another of God, pray for us sinners. Now and at the hour of our death, amen. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit as it was in the beginning is now and shall be world without end. Amen. The Lord be with you and with your spirit and may the peace and blessing of Almighty God, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit come down on you and remain with you forever. Amen. Go in peace. Thanks be to God.
