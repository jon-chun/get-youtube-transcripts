to make our men a blessing or a blessing, and glory of our gladdies for any time. The new life that we receive in Christ begins at our baptism, in which we are washed clean in the sanctifying waters, and enlightened with the light of Christ. We are configured to His death and resurrection, and are given a candle to signify the new life of grace, which has begun in us, which is why this evening everyone will be invited to come forward, and take part in a great Dominican tradition for this feast day, the Oblacio Candelaro. All will come forward with their lighted candles, and bring it to the priest to be placed before the altar of sacrifice. Our candles signify the offering of our very lives to God, lives which now burn brightly with the light of Christ. At this mass, our candles will become the very lights that surround the altar, when Jesus comes to us in the Eucharist, serving as a reminder that when we come to mass, all of our prayers, our needs and desires, indeed our very lives are united to Christ's eternal sacrifice on the altar. But our candles will also burn down and eventually go out, reminding us that this life is passing, that one day we will die as Christ died. But our union with Him and His death is not the end of the story for us. For Jesus will raise us up to a new and glorious life, just as He has risen. On that day we will no longer need the light of candles for Christ Himself will be our light. In the Holy Eucharist, as we bring all of our needs before the Lord, He unites them to His death, with the promise of transforming them by the power of His resurrection. In the Eucharist, we find the lasting, tangible presence of Christ with us, even after He has ascended to the Father. A light still shines brightly in our churches, indicating the presence of God in this holy place. The Eucharist is not some mere symbol, but truly is the body, blood, soul and divinity of the risen Christ. Every time we come into our churches, we can pray with reverence and devotion to the Lord of the universe, who is here in a much different way from how He was present in the Temple of Old. Behind this veil, within the tabernacle, He is here, and soon He will come to us as true spiritual food when we come forward and receive His body and blood in Holy Communion. Then that presence of Christ will be within the temples of our very selves, as we feed on Jesus, who nourishes us, and sustains us as we go forth from here into a world that is often hostile and ignorant of the faith, which is why the light of our candles must never go out. They must always indicate the presence of Christ in our lives. Now it isn't practical, nor probably the best thing to go everywhere carrying a lighted candle, but the way we live our lives must be the light which shines throughout the world. That light must never burn out. When people meet us, they always see the presence of Christ radiating in our lives, for He has come to us as our Savior and Redeemer. In the Eucharist, He unites us with His Holy Sacrifice, which is true and perfect worship, and He remains with us as the source of grace and mercy to help us in our every need and to strengthen us as we become His witnesses to all the nations.
