In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. I confess, for my God, unto you and my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words, and what I have done and what I have failed to do to my fault, to my fault, to my husband's fault. Therefore I ask the Blessed Mary of our Virgin, all the indolent saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord. May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Here is the Son, here is the Son. Glory to God in the highest. Glory to God in the highest. Glory to God in the highest. Glory to God in the highest. Glory to God in the highest. Let us pray, oh God, strength of those who hope in you, graciously hear our pleas. And since without you mortal frailty can do nothing, grant us always the help of your grace that in following your commands, we may please you by our resolve and our deeds, through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever. Amen. A reading from the Book of Exodus. In those days, the Israelites came to the desert of Sinai and pitched camp. While Israel was encamped here in the front of the mountain, Moses went up the mountain to God. Then the Lord called to him and said, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, tell the Israelites, You have seen for yourselves how I treated the Egyptians and how I bore you up on eagle wings and brought you here to myself. Therefore, if you harken to my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my special possession, dare to me than all other people, though all earth is mine. You shall be to me a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, the Word of the Lord. Amen. We are His people, the sheep of His God. We are His people, the sheep of His God. Cry out with joy to the Lord of the earth, so the Lord will gladness from before Him singing for joy. We are His people, the sheep of His God. Now that He the Lord is God, He made us weep below to Him. We are His people, the sheep of His God. We are His people, the sheep of His God. In thee, how good is the Lord, He turned our face as the fill of His sickle from age to age. We are His people, the sheep of His God. A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Romans, brothers and sisters, Christ, while we were still helpless, yet died at the appointed time for the ungodly. Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person, though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die. But God proves His love for us, and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. How much more than since we are now justified by His blood will we be saved through Him from the wrath? Indeed, if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son. How much more once reconciled will we be saved by His life? Not only that, but we are also boast of God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. The Word of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. I'll read in from the Holy Ghost, full of cordon to Matthew. The mess of all Satan, the Holy Ghost, full of all. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. At the sight of the crowds, Jesus' heart was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and abandoned, like sheep without a shepherd. Then He said to His disciples, the harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few, so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for His harvest. Then He summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to drive them out and to cure every disease and every illness. The names of the twelve apostles are these. First Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Altheus and Thadius, Simon from Cana, and Judas Ascariot who betrayed Him. Jesus sent out these twelve after instructing them thus. Do not go into pagan territory or enter a Samaritan town. Go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go make this proclamation, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons. Without cost you have received, without cost you are to give. The gospel of the Lord. Through the words of the Lord. In the creed we profess our faith in one holy Catholic and apostolic church, what we typically call the four marks of the church. These marks are our identifiers, aspects that are integral to the church founded by Jesus Christ. They allow us to recognize the true church, a church which possesses a unity rooted in Christ, which is holy because of the sacraments He gave us. Which is Catholic, that is universal, both in the fullness of what it teaches and in the breath of where it has spread. And which is apostolic, that is which is built upon the foundation of the twelve apostles, sent out by Christ. When we say that the church is one holy and Catholic, we are looking at marks that pertain more to the inner life of the church. But when we say that the church is apostolic, our focus shifts to how the church interacts with the world in which it lives. The filling Christ's call to go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. In today's gospel we hear the names of the twelve apostles as a way of reminding us that these were real men and not just some characters in a good story. Some worked hard with their hands like Peter and Andrew who were fishermen. The apostles' age is varied as John was known to be quite young when he was called. One of them, Judas Iscariot, did not remain faithful to the Lord. Yet he is still mentioned because we need to be honest with our human weakness and to remember that we are all sinners and that we can still fall from grace. And as we read from St. Matthew's gospel, we see that the author mentions himself as one of the apostles, showing us that his account is personal and that what we read comes from an eyewitness who followed the Lord Jesus. And who was sent out by him. The church is apostolic because it was built on the foundation of twelve actual people with all their strengths and all their weaknesses. Jesus sent them forth to proclaim his message of salvation and he continues to do that in his one holy Catholic and apostolic church. The church is apostolic because Jesus' ministry of teaching sanctifying and leading his people continues. Not in some hypothetical or even a mere spiritual sense, but like the apostles through actual people. The bishops of the church are the successors of the apostles and priests who stand with them as co-workers help them in carrying out their mission. This upcoming week, Bishop Fernandez and the priests of the diocese will be spending a few days at the priest's convocation, praying together, having opportunities for fellowship and for discussion on important matters facing our local church. A number of us Dominican priests will also be joining our brother priests from here in the diocese. And so we ask for your prayers this week as we seek some quiet time for renewal in our ministry that we may be better equipped to carry out the apostolic mission entrusted to us by Christ as teachers, priests and shepherds of the church. But we also know that this work will not end with us. Others will be needed to carry on the Lord's mission. Jesus says to his disciples, the harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few, so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest. Vocations to the priesthood and the religious life don't just happen or come out of nowhere. Just as Jesus called his apostles and sent them forth, he still calls young men to take up the gospel and follow him as priests. Vocations to the priesthood are nourished over time in families or by friends and are encouraged by the faithful who may see the call in a young man who is serious about his faith. They come out of parishes like our own. And so many of our parishioners over the last few years have followed the Lord down this path. Even now we find ourselves in exciting times as our parish will be starting up a discernment group for boys who may be thinking about the priesthood. It may begin small, but where it leads will be directed by the Holy Spirit, but such as the case with any vocation to the priesthood. The priest planted by the Lord must blossom to full maturity, follow the Lord's plea, and ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest. Pray for vocations, and if you know any young men who may be thinking about a priestly vocation, encourage them to be open to God's will for their lives. And likewise pray and encourage vocations to the religious life, especially for any young women who may wish to serve the church as sisters. The Apostolic Mark of the Church continues through the pastoral care of our bishops, ensuring that the doctrine that we follow was authentic and that the sacraments that we celebrate are real. But it does not mean that only clergy are Apostolic, all of us who have been baptized, who have been marked by the Lord Jesus as His disciples, also have a role to play in the church's Apostolic mission. In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, we read that the whole church is Apostolic, and that the Christian vocation is of its nature, of vocation to the Apostolate as well. We can think of an Apostolate as some ministry or work of service that we do for the church, perhaps we already find ourselves doing that. Or we may be challenged to put our faith into greater action. When considering what it means to be Apostolic, we must remember that it means to be sensed by the Lord Jesus. The Christian disciple fulfills the Lord's Apostolic call by remaining faithful to Him and not going astray like Judas. This is the first and most important thing to keep in mind. As followers of Christ, we become His witnesses sanctifying the world by our holiness of life and teaching others about Him through our words and example. This can be seen in daily tasks at home or at work or can take on a more formal aspect through some ministry and a postulate. Here at St. Patrick's, several parishioners over the last year have taken part in our Evangelical Catholic Apostolate, in which they gathered here to pray and learn about how to reach out and evangelize others before going to places where the gospel has yet to be heard.
