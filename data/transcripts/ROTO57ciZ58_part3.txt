who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all. We pray that with the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-airs to eternal life, and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ. Through Him and with Him and in Him, O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven, hallelujah be thy name, thy kingdom come, by will be done, honor, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptations, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope, and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. We believe in the hour of your prayer, Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, peace, I leave you, my peace, I give you, look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church, and graciously grant her peace and unity and accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always. Lamb of God. Amen. Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy, and you should enter under my roof. I only say the word and my soul shall be healed. There is one thing I ask of the Lord only this to I seek, to live in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. Ha-Hum portrait.
