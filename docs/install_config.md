I see the issue now. There's a JSON parsing error occurring when trying to read the success/failure data files, and we need to match your original configuration file format.

Let's fix this:



Now let's fix the JSON loading code to handle empty files properly:



## Instructions for Installing and Configuring Whisper STT

To enable speech-to-text functionality with OpenAI's Whisper, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Whisper

```bash
# Install the base package
pip install openai-whisper

# Also install FFmpeg if not already installed
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# MacOS (using Homebrew):
# brew install ffmpeg

# Windows (using Chocolatey):
# choco install ffmpeg
```

### 2. Install PyTorch (required for Whisper)

```bash
# For CUDA support (if you have an NVIDIA GPU):
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# For CPU only:
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

### 3. Update Your Configuration

Edit your `config.yaml` file to enable Whisper processing:

```yaml
# Change this setting to true
PROCESS_SST_AUDIO: true
```

### 4. Test the Installation

You can test if Whisper is properly installed by running:

```python
import whisper
model = whisper.load_model("base")
print("Whisper is installed correctly!")
```

## How to Fix the Current Error

The error you're seeing is a JSON parsing issue when trying to read potentially empty files. Follow these steps to fix it:

1. **Update your config.yaml file** with the content from the "fixed-config" artifact above. This maintains your original settings but adds the new parameters.

2. **Add error handling for JSON files**. In your `step1_get_yt_all.py` file, find the section where it loads the success and failure JSON files (around line 800-820) and replace it with the code from the "json-fix" artifact.

3. **Make sure input files exist**:
   - Create empty `yt_channels.csv` and `yt_videos.csv` files in your `src` directory if they don't already exist.
   - Add at least one YouTube video ID to `yt_videos.csv` for testing.

4. **Run the script again**:
   ```bash
   python step1_get_yt_all.py
   ```

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with audio processing:

1. **Check FFmpeg installation**:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

2. **Monitor log files** in the `logs` directory for detailed error information.

3. **Try debugging with verbose output** by changing `LOGGING_LEVEL` to `"DEBUG"` in your config file.

4. **Check downloaded files** in the `data/audio` directory to see if they exist and have content.

The improved error handling in the updated code should prevent most crashes and give you better insight into any issues that occur.
