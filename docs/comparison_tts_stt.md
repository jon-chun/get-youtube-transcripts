#### Performance/Size/Speed Trade-offs on Dual RTX 3090 Ubuntu System

Given the dual RTX 3090 setup with 48 GB total VRAM, the trade-offs are as follows:

- **STT Models**:
  - **Whisper**: Larger models (e.g., large, 1550M) fit on one GPU (~10 GB VRAM), offering high accuracy but slower for real-time; smaller models (e.g., tiny, 39M) are faster but less accurate, suitable for parallel tasks.
  - **DeepSpeech**: Efficient on GPU, ~1.1 GB fits easily, good for real-time, but accuracy may not match Whisper large.
  - **Kaldi**: Models like M13 (~1.5 GB) fit well, high accuracy, but setup complexity may slow initial deployment.
  - **SpeechBrain**: Models like wav2vec2-large (317M) fit on one GPU, good balance, but performance varies by dataset.
  - **Wav2vec 2.0**: Large model (317M) fits on one GPU, top accuracy, but may need both GPUs for concurrent tasks.

- **TTS Models**:
  - **XTTS-v2**: ~345M parameters, fits easily, efficient for real-time (<200ms latency), high quality across 16 languages.
  - **TortoiseTTS**: Large, likely fits on one GPU, high quality (MOS 4.05), but slower generation may limit concurrent use.
  - **StyleTTS 2**: Likely fits on one GPU, human-level quality, but resource-intensive for real-time, may need both GPUs for optimization.
  - **MeloTTS**: ~100M parameters, fits easily, CPU real-time efficient, leverages GPU for faster inference, good for resource-constrained tasks.
  - **OpenVoice v2**: ~100M parameters, fits easily, versatile for voice cloning, efficient on GPU, but may need reference audio setup.

In summary, larger models offer higher accuracy or quality but require more VRAM and may be slower, while smaller, efficient models like MeloTTS are ideal for real-time applications with less resource demand. The dual RTX 3090 setup provides ample resources, allowing users to balance these trade-offs based on specific needs, such as real-time transcription versus high-accuracy batch processing.

## Performance/Size/Speed Tradeoffs on Dual RTX 3090 Ubuntu System

Running these models on a dual RTX 3090 Ubuntu system offers significant advantages but requires careful consideration of tradeoffs:

### Memory Management

The RTX 3090's 24GB of VRAM per card provides ample headroom for most models. For STT, even the largest Whisper models consume approximately 12-16GB, leaving room for additional processing[3][15]. Smaller models like Distil-Whisper's small variant (166M parameters) or Kokoro TTS (82M parameters) use minimal VRAM, enabling multiple models to run simultaneously across the two GPUs.

### Power Optimization

Research shows RTX 3090 cards can be power-limited to 250W-300W (down from 350W) with minimal performance impact, saving approximately 100W per card[10]. For inference workloads, this optimization reduces power consumption and heat without sacrificing meaningful performance. Using nvidia-smi to limit power draw is recommended for 24/7 operation.

### Performance Scaling

For layer-split models, each GPU typically reaches about 25% utilization during inference, while tensor parallel implementations increase utilization to approximately 50%[17]. With dual RTX 3090s, you could:
- Run different models on each GPU (e.g., STT on one, TTS on another)
- Distribute a single large model across both GPUs
- Process multiple audio streams in parallel

### Optimization Techniques

To maximize performance on this hardware:
1. Use Flash Attention 2 with compatible models for significant speedups[14]
2. Implement BetterTransformers for models that don't support Flash Attention
3. Consider whisper.cpp for Whisper models, which significantly outperforms the PyTorch implementation
4. Utilize quantized models where accuracy permits, especially for real-time applications

### Practical Performance

Benchmarks show impressive real-world performance:
- Distil-Whisper can process 100 minutes of audio in just 2m 17s on an RTX 3090 with Flash Attention 2[4]
- Whisper.cpp medium model can process approximately 3,000 WPM on an RTX 3090[3]
- TTS models like Kokoro can operate in real-time even on CPU, with significantly better performance on RTX 3090s

## Conclusion

The open-source STT and TTS landscape has evolved dramatically through early 2025, with models becoming simultaneously more powerful and more efficient. For STT, Distil-Whisper offers the best balance of accuracy and speed for English-only applications, while full Whisper models remain the gold standard for multilingual support. In TTS, Kokoro represents a remarkable achievement in efficiency, while XTTS-v2 and Fish Speech provide superior voice quality and cloning capabilities.

A dual RTX 3090 Ubuntu system provides more than adequate computational power for deploying these models, with enough headroom to run multiple models simultaneously or process multiple streams in parallel. By applying appropriate optimizations, this hardware configuration can deliver exceptional performance while maintaining reasonable power consumption and thermal characteristics.
